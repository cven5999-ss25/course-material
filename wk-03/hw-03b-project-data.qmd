# Project data

Working with data is most effective when it is data that you are interested in yourself. Designing a research study is beyond the scope of this course, but maybe you already have data available that you want to analyse. Otherwise, there is plenty of data available online that you could use for a data analysis project.

Some examples of popular and extensive Open Data repositories are:

-   World Bank Open Data: https://data.worldbank.org/
-   The Humanitarian Data Exchange: https://data.humdata.org/
-   Harvard Dataverse: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/
-   Figshare: https://figshare.com/
-   Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/

# Task 1: Identify data

1.  Identify data that you are interested in. The requirements are:

-   small (maximum 8 variables/columns and 10000 rows/observations)
-   in tabular format (ideally CSV file format, but XLSX is also okay)
-   relevant to the wider topics of Global Engineering, Development, etc.

2.  Describe why you have chosen this data
